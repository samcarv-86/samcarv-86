- 👋 Hi, I’m Samuel Carvalho
- 👀 I’m interested in electrical engineering (automation/robotics/electric machinery/control systems).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a few progamming languages (python and power apps), improving others (matlab/simulink) and studying for my Electrical Engineering Master of Science degree @ UFRGS (www.ppgee.ufrgs.br).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on free solutions manuals for electrical engineering text books using LaTeX.
- 📫 How to reach me: by e-mail (eng.samuelcarvalho@gmail.com) or instagram (@samuel.carvalho86)
